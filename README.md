# player_rating

## This is a work in progress project, currently on hold.

Overall goal : Create a way to rate players of any given sport. Make a rating system used to attempt to predict wins, losses, and player performance.


## Current Project: 
1. Create file directory with starter file to get good idea of structure and workflow.
2. Continuation of database construction, design, and implementation. First time, so I could be going at this the wrong way, but the experience will teach me lessons.

## Tools Used
Python, Excel, 
SQLite3, Requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib
